title: Overview

This course provides a quick intro to
[D3.js](http://d3js.org/), a Javascript library for creating data visualizations
in the browser. D3 is built on top of common web standards like HTML, CSS, and SVG.

D3 makes web-based visualizations easier by "automating the hard bits you already
understand," as opposed to "hiding the hard
bits" (hat tip [@andy_matuschak](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/365547794129358849)).

Again, this course is _not_ a deep dive. The goal is get a high-level understanding of D3 basics.
