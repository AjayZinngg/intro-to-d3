In this course, we're going to provide a quick intro to
[D3.js](http://d3js.org/). It's a Javascript library with a lot of little pieces
and we use it for creating data visualizations in the browser. It relies a lot
on web standards.

A good way to approach D3 is a library that helps by
"automating the hard bits you already understand" as opposed to "hiding the hard
bits" (hat tip [@andy_matuschak](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/365547794129358849)).

This is a quick tour, not a deep-dive. The goal here is to learn how to
learn D3, not to learn everything at once.
