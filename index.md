### Background

In Square's New Engineer Onboarding program, we offer short courses and lectures
on tools the variety of tools that Square uses. We started to collect notes from
our course on D3.js and found that it was well-suited to a written tutorial, and
was worth sharing.

### Introduction

This course provides a quick intro to
[D3.js](http://d3js.org/), a Javascript library for creating data visualizations
in the browser. D3 is built on top of common web standards like HTML, CSS, and SVG.

D3 makes web-based visualizations easier by "automating the hard bits you already
understand," as opposed to "hiding the hard
bits" (hat tip [@andy_matuschak](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/365547794129358849)).

Again, this course is _not_ a deep dive. The goal is get a high-level understanding of D3 basics.
