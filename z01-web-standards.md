Like we mentioned, D3 takes advantage of a lot of web standards.

### HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a text format that most web pages are
written in. It's loosely related to the XML family, but much less strict (for
example some tags such as `<br>` don't need matching closing tags.

The basic outline of an HTML page is something like this:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>TITLE GOES HERE</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    MAIN CONTENT GOES HERE
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

### CSS

CSS (Cascading Stylesheets) is a language for styling web pages.

### The DOM

### SVG

like a whirlwind tour of web standards, these are the hard bits you already understand (or if you don’t, it’s ok! you can pick this stuff up pretty quicky

HTML/CSS
The DOM
Chrome is almost your IDE
SVG (ex, here’s how to draw a graph the hard way by writing our SVG)
SVG/CSS (the same….but different)
