So what does D3 actually do?

axis / scales / coordinate systems (input data maps to here, x/y maps to screen)
I have a range of 20 x 20 units, but it maps to a box of 400x500 on the screen (flipped coords, etc)
SVG is Y-Down, most graphs are Y-UP
units / labels (auto-generate date labels, etc)
Dates!
colors are just another scale!
ZOMG color 10
