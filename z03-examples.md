Ok so let’s work through a quick example

The standard D3 flow

Data binding: “match these data points to these things in the DOM”

select
append
update
remove
Demo with fixed data (d3.json + python SimpleHTTPServer)

(unsure what goes here)
Thinking of building two Radiator endpoints, and demo-ing one of them

GPV endpoint with URL params to filter by currency code, group by {day,week,month} or {mcc}
Demo with simple bar chart
Payments endpoint (last X payments), filter by currency code, mcc,
Demo with a scatterplot (date vs amount)
